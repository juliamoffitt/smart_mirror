Project: Smart Mirror

Technologies: C, GTK+3.0, RaspberryPi 3

Description: Will display date, time, weather using data parsed from XML file
provided by openweathermap.org. Will use GTK+3 to create the UI.
After development is finished I will use a two way mirror backed with a computer
monitor connected to the RaspBerryPi.

Challenges: Learning how to use GTK+3, working with the main event loop
